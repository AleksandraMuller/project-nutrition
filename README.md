# Project Nutrition built with React Redux 🍓 🍌 🥝

In this project I have built an app which scans barcodes on food packages to retrieve the product name and nutritional information. I used the [Open world facts api](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) to fetch the product information. I also have a component which uses [quagga](https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS) to access the webcam to scan the barcodes of the products. I used styled-components for styling.

## In this project, you will find:
Redux store
Reducers and actions
Interaction with store using selectors and by dispatching actions

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning 🔨
I used functional React to build this project. The project is divided into multiple Components. If I had more time, I would try to use the API´s to create something more creative. I would also spend even more time on styling.
